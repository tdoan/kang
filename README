KANG - The Ruby Regex Debugger

This is a cross-platform GUI application. To run it you'll need Ruby (I've only tested with 1.8.7 so far) and the wxruby gem (I've only tested with 1.9.8).

On an OS X Macintosh with MacPorts available:
sudo port install ruby
sudo port install rb-rubygems
sudo gem install wxruby
Then just run bin/kang.rb

Enjoy!
